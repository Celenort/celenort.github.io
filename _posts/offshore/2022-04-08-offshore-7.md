# How to Product Hydrocarbon Part III

### Ideal gas vs Real gas behavior

- as pressure rises, the volume decreases more than expected (molecular attraction)
- should use z (coefficient) < 1 

### Real gas deviation from ideal

- Compressibility factor Z
- $$ Z = ({V_{actual}\over V_{ideal} }) $$
- always less than 1
- not PV/T, PV/TZ is constant
- $$ {P_1 V_1 \over T_1 Z_1} = {P_2 V_2 \over T_2 Z_2} $$

#### Exercise 1 : Gas volume behavior

- Pressure : Absolute = Gauge(측정계 압력) + 14.7psi(대기압)
- Temperature : Rankine : T 'F + 460 (273K같은거), Kelvin : T 'C +273

### How to find Compressibility factor Z

#### Determine Critical constants at gas mixture

- $$ P_{c,mix} = \sigma_i (molfrac) \times P_{c,i} $$

- $$ T_{c,mix} = \sigma_i (molfrac) \times T_{c,i} $$

- They are reffered to as Psuedo - Crtical Pressure/Temperature : $ P_{pc}, T_{pc} $

#### Reduced Pressure, Temperature

- $$ P_\gamma = {P_{system}\over P_C} $$

- $$ T_\gamma = {T_{system}\over T_C} $$

### Tc, Pc from SG

- If we don't know the composition of gas, but its specific gravity, they can be figured out using correlations.

- X axis : SG / Y axis : Pc, Tc (Upper/Lower) 
- get SG, match corrosponding y coord in graph

### To figure out compressibility factor Z 

- using graph, X axis : P_pc / Y axis : Compressibility factor / Graphs : Temperature

- fix X axis by Pseudo Pressure.crit / choose graph by Pseudo Temp.Crit / read Y coord

#### Exercise 

1.  Calculate the hydrostatic head of seawater and the methanol at 8000 FSW. Seawater : 1.03g/cc , Methanol : 0.814 g/cc 

- g/cc x ft x 0.43353 = psi
- lb/ft^3 x ft x 0.006944 = psi
- g/cc x m x 0.09809 = bar

- Seawater (psi) : $ 1.03 \times 8000 FSW \times 0.43353 =3572psi $
- Methanol (psi) : $ 0.814 \times 8000 FSW \times 0.43353 =2823psi $

2. Suppose you had a pipe that extended from topsides (100ft above sea leval) to the seafloor with a closed valve aat the sefloor but open at topsides.

    - (a) What would happen if the pipe were fileld with seawater and the valve at the seafloor were opened ?
    - A : $ 1.03 \times 8100 FSW \times 0.43353 =3616psi $ , $\Delta P = 3616-3572 = 48psi $ - -> The seawater in the pipe will flood out from the bottom of the valve and the height of the water will be syncronized to sea level.

    - (b) What would happen if the pipe were filled with methanol and the seafloor valve were opened. (Suppose that Methanol and sea water does not mix)
    - A : $ 0.814 \times 8100 FSW \times 0.43353 =2858psi $
    - -> y (ft) Methanol / x (ft) of Seawater / x+y=8100, Hydrostatic head of 8000ft seawater = total sum of h.h. $ 3572 = 0.814 \times y \times 8000 \times 0.43353 + 1.03 \times x \times 0.43353 $
    - y=477ft.
