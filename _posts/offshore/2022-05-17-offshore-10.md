### Process Classification

- By type : Batch, Semi-batch, continuous
- By status : steady-state or transient

- Batch : Incontinuous Process (Feed -> React -> Remove) (unsteady state)
- continuous : flow at constant rate (un / steady state)
- Semi-batch : pressurized gas container, can escape gas to the atmosphere (unsteady state)

- Steady state : T, P, V, flow rate is invarient with time
- Transient : (천이 상태) varient with time

- Continuous : close to steady state but transient state exists. (change of state)

### Balance - General Balance Equation

- If input flow rate =/= output flow rate 

1. The material is consumed as a reactant or generated as a product within the unit
2. The material is accumulated in the unit
3. Leaking
4. Wrong measurement

- input + generation - output - consumption = accumulation
- for continuous process at steady state : accumulation = 0

### Flowchart

- x : component fraction, y : gas fraction
- Balanced Process (Input = output mass(or flow rate)) : Scale up, down 가능. (common factor 곱하여서)
- 이미 알고있는 Mass/Molar fraction에 대해서 해당 Mass/Mole flow rate를 basis로 설정.

### Vapor and gas

- Vapor : gaseous species below its critical temperature, gas : above its critical temperature at a pressure low enough for the species ot be more like a vapor than a liquid

### Values

- Precentage Excess of A : 
- $${ {n_{A,fed}- n_{A,stoich}} \over {n_{A,stoich}}} $$

- Fractional Cionversion :
- $${ {mols Reacted}\over {molsfed}}$$

- Extent of reaction :
- $$\xi = { {n_i-n_0}\over{n_0}}$$

- stoichiometric coefficient : $\nu_i$ : 반응식에서 계수, 반응물이면 음수
- Yield : 
- $${ {desiredprod}\over{desiredprod if no inverse}}$$

- selectivity : 
- $${ {formeddesiredprod}\over{formedundesiredprod}}$$

- DOF : No. Var + No. Independent reaction - No. Independent reactive species

- Theorical Oxygen : All carbons/ Hydrogen / Sulfers are oxidized to CO2, H2O, SO2

- % excess oxygen

- Superheat : Current Temp - T_dp (10'c of superheat.)

- Relative Saturation :
- $${p\over p^*}$$

### Clapeyron Equation

- $${dp*\over dT} = {\Delta \hat{H_v}\over T(\hat{V_g}-\hat{V_liq})}$$
- Specific Volume of Liquid is negligible
- $${d(lnp*)\over d(1/T)} = -{\Delta \hat{H_v}\over R}$$
- Plotting lnp* as y and 1/T as x, B : Const(when t->inf, lnp* is B)

### Antoine Equation

- $$log_{10} p^* = A - {B\over T+C}$$
